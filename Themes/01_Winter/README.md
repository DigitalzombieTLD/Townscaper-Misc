# Winter theme

Great in combinaison with the [LittleWeather](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/TownscaperLittleWeather) mod. 

* Black birds!
* Snow everywhere!
* Different windows and doors!
* Red boots!
* More snow! 
* New colors! 
* ...and also very pretty at night!


_Recommendation: put the sun very low in order to not be blinded by the snow reflection._
