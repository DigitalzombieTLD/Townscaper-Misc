_This folder lists community themes made by modifying the textures files._ 

## How to use themes 

Before adding files to your Texture¹ folder, ⚠️ **be sure to make a backup of existing files** ⚠️by saving them in a new "Backup" folder somewhere on your computer. 
It is recommended to also create a different folder to store files when you're not using them.

▶ Replace the files in the Texture¹ folder by the provided files. The changes will apply immediately.

### Texture¹ folder location

* Windows: `..\AppData\LocalLow\Oskar Stalberg\Townscaper\Textures`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/com.OskarStalberg.Townscaper`

### Remove
To remove a theme, replace the files in your Texture¹ folder by the ones in your backup folder or in the Default folder. 

### How can I do if I play on mobile or switch or anything else than a computer? 
Sadly, you can't at the moment.
